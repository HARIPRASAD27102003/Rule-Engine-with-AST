# üöÄ Rule Engine Project

This is a **Django-based web application** for managing and combining rules using an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. Users can create, edit, delete, and combine rules using operators like `AND` and `OR`. The project leverages the flexibility of Python and Django to provide an interface for rule management and complex logical operations.

## üìã Features

- **List Rules**: Displays all existing rules with their string representations and ASTs.
- **Edit Rules**: Allows editing rule strings in the interface and updates the database.
- **Delete Rules**: Provides the option to select multiple rules and delete them.
- **Combine Rules**: Users can select multiple rules and combine them using logical operators (`AND` or `OR`).
- **AST Representation**: The system stores rules in AST form for easy manipulation and evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### List Rules
- Access the rule list at `/list-rules/` to view all existing rules along with their names, rule strings, and AST representations.

### Edit Rules
1. On the rule list page, click the **Edit** button next to the rule you wish to modify.
2. In the inline form, update the rule string as needed.
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes to the database.

### Delete Rules
1. On the rule list page, select the rules you want to delete using the checkboxes.
2. Click **Delete Selected Rules** to remove the selected rules from the system.

### Combine Rules
1. Navigate to `/combine-rules/` to access the rule combination form.
2. Select multiple rules from the available list to combine.
3. Choose a logical operator (`AND` or `OR`) for combining the selected rules.
4. Click **Combine Rules** to generate the combined rule string and view the result.

## üåê API Endpoints

- **`GET /list-rules/`**: 
  - **Description**: Retrieve a list of all available rules with their string and AST representations.
  
- **`POST /edit-rule/<int:rule_id>/`**: 
  - **Description**: Edit an existing rule identified by `rule_id`. Requires the updated rule string in the request body.

- **`POST /delete-rules/`**: 
  - **Description**: Delete selected rules. The request should include the IDs of the rules to be deleted.

- **`POST /combine-rules/`**: 
  - **Description**: Combine selected rules using logical operators. Requires the selected rule IDs and the chosen operator (AND/OR) in the request body.
